# React Native App

This is made with expo. Never ever try without it. You can use bare React Native and Android Studio to build apk if you had many years in hand, gemini pro and get mad!

# Before starting again..

Read readme.txt
Even then you want to do.. proceed. After developing in expo, read build.txt to generate apk.
Don't expect this project has everything so that you modify text and throw it in playstore. It literally does not has any useful things ;).

# Features
*  It just had Text, View, TouchableOpacity. Nothing more than that.
*  Doesn't have any type of Navigations
*  Basic tab navigation implemented but it's on own
*  No styling frameworks used
*  Didn't even have a single flatList to display data.
*  No other fonts imported or used.
*  So if you want to learn, change your decision and focus on something else.

# Want to see?
Download all files, unzip, run npm install, then, wait, then npm start. Boom. Install expo on phone, then throw this screen away. So there's other simpler option. There's an apk hidden in assets folder. Go on and install. See the mess..

Good Luck!
