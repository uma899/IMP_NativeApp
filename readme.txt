You are reading this again? Please don't. Close it immediately and do useful things instead. This eats your time unconsciously. If much need of developing a 'Native App', then go ahead..

This contain building react native app with expo.

Just do in expo. Never ever try to do with bare React Native. You already had very bad experience with it!

Note that no android studio needed to do in expo. Just see build.txt to know how to generate apk..

Good luck. Again, you'll get messed with android studio if you try without expo..
