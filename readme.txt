  From this day, I wasted 3 months, literally "3 months" hoping building an App which change the world. Finally I built a purely Native app which is aple to show an alert saying "Happy Birthday". Whoa, I built an app In Android Studio! Then my journey went to React Native. I built something, lost it and thought of never start it again. But, as you know you are a kin of person who don't have brain but thinks that he has. So I again started same dirty journey on 17-06-2025 and decided to end on 18-06-2025. The time is 17:30 at the moment writing this word. This song [https://youtu.be/6Qt5pG1E34s?si=mT5c-Xw9QzL_kbKM] is playing at this moment. It's gettong dark. I had to go to a 10km marathon on roof top. Ok, coming to point, I decided to leave App dev. I want me to promise not to start thisthing again. But it got broke now as I just read what I want to. Very bad!


If much need of developing a 'Native App' or else you're going to beg, then go ahead..

This contain building react native app with expo.

Just do in expo. Never ever try to do with bare React Native. You already had very bad experience with it!

Note that no android studio needed to do in expo. Just see build.txt to know how to generate apk..

Good luck. Again, you'll get messed with android studio if you try without expo..
