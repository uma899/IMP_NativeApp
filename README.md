# React Native App

This is made with expo. Never ever try without it. You can use bare React Native and Android Studio to build apk if you had many years in hand, gemini pro and get mad!

# Before starting again..

Give your 5 mins. This 5 mins will help you prevent your part of a lifetime. Okay, coming to point

  From this day, I wasted 3 months, literally "3 months" hoping building an App which change the world. Finally I built a purely Native app which is aple to show an alert saying "Happy Birthday". Whoa, I built an app In Android Studio! Then my journey went to React Native. I built something, lost it and thought of never start it again. But, as you know you are a kin of person who don't have brain but thinks that he has. So I again started same dirty journey on 17-06-2025 and decided to end on 18-06-2025. The time is 17:30 at the moment writing this word. This [song](https://youtu.be/6Qt5pG1E34s?si=mT5c-Xw9QzL_kbKM])) is playing at this moment. Wondered how I got link? I searced on google. You know, you are you. You wonder you have brain but you your brain wonder why you wonder like that. Again you're wondering.. It's gettong dark. I had to go to a 10km marathon on roof top. Ok, coming to point, I decided to leave App dev. I want me to promise not to start thisthing again. But it got broke now as I just read what I want to. Very bad!


If much need of developing a 'Native App' or else you're going to beg, then go ahead..

This contain building react native app with expo.

Just do in expo. Never ever try to do with bare React Native. You already had very bad experience with it!

Note that no android studio needed to do in expo. Just see build.txt to know how to generate apk..

Good luck. Again, you'll get messed with android studio if you try without expo..


Even then you want to do.. proceed. After developing in expo, read build.txt to generate apk.
Don't expect this project has everything so that you modify text and throw it in playstore. It literally does not has any useful things ;).

# Features
*  It just had Text, View, TouchableOpacity. Nothing more than that.
*  Doesn't have any type of Navigations
*  Basic tab navigation implemented but it's on own
*  No styling frameworks used
*  Didn't even have a single flatList to display data.
*  No other fonts imported or used.
*  So if you want to learn, change your decision and focus on something else.

# Want to see?
Download all files, unzip, run npm install, then, wait, then npm start. Boom. Install expo on phone, then throw this screen away. So there's other simpler option. There's an apk 'hidden' in assets folder. Go on and install. See the mess.. If not worked, get apk at [limk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17j6fXVviW0cEM-51ecNeAnVQkWVL5O-w/view?usp=sharing)

Good Luck!
